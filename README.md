# conditioning
These scripts were used to operate our custom-build setup for aversive olfactory conditioning (Drosophila). All scripts were written by Benjamin Escribano, see https://github.com/BenjaminEscribano/DomiNator for more scripts,
I adjusted original codes as needed. After connecting the control unit (operates light and shock exposure) using the 'ConnectAndConfigureDevice' script the conditioning scripts can be executed.
